      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p> GIT is a version control software that allows you to edit and track source code. You can work on a local reposity of a code, and have a version controlled copy in a repository that others can access. This allows for multiple people to work on a code at the same time, while keeping track of each commit they make. Version control is important when updating code incase you need to roll back to an older version, track bugs, or even remove entire code commits. Version control gives you the fleixibility to update and test new code without the fear of losing older, working versions.

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>1) A local repo is a copy of your project, whether it be a collection of code or files, that you store locally on your computer. When editing these codes or files, you want to use your local repo to make edits and keep track of the changes. When you are finished with your changes, you commit and push your changes to a remote repo.
      2) A remote repo is the version controlled storage location for the code or project that you are working on. A remote repo, like GitHub, contains all of the commit messages, past changes, and allows for multiple users to connect to it. In practice, users will create local repo's to make their changes, and when they are finished, they will push them back to the remote repo to merge their changes and update the master files.
      3) GIT is powerful when used in a Team Project. Each member of the team can create a local repo of the project. They can change the code or files in their local repo and create commit messages to help track the changes they make. When each member of the team is ready to have the remote repo updated, they can push their changes to GIT. When everyone pushes their changes to GIT, the project will be updated and will have the full history of changes made my each individual. This process allows multiple people to work on a single file or code, with version control, without overwritting each other.
